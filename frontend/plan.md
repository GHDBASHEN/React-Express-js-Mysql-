### Comprehensive Plan for Enhancements to frontend/src/App.js

#### Information Gathered:
- The `App.js` file is a React component that manages user data by fetching, adding, and deleting users through API calls to the backend.
- Currently, there is no error handling implemented for the API requests, which could lead to unhandled exceptions and a poor user experience.

#### Plan:
- **Enhancements to Implement:**
  - Add error handling for the `fetchUsers` function to handle any errors that occur during the API call and provide feedback to the user.
  - Implement error handling in the `addUser` function to catch any errors when adding a new user and inform the user of the failure.
  - Include error handling in the `deleteUser` function to manage any errors that occur when deleting a user and notify the user accordingly.
  - Consider displaying error messages in the UI instead of using alerts for a better user experience.

#### Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `frontend/src/App.js` will be the primary file to modify.

#### Follow-up Steps:
- After implementing the changes, test the application to ensure that error handling works correctly and that users receive appropriate feedback for any issues encountered.
