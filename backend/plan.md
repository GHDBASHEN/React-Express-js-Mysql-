### Comprehensive Plan for Enhancements to backend/server.js

#### Information Gathered:
- The `backend/server.js` file sets up an Express server that connects to a MySQL database and provides CRUD operations for users.
- The server includes routes for:
  - Retrieving all users (`GET /users`)
  - Adding a new user (`POST /users`)
  - Updating a user by ID (`PUT /users/:id`)
  - Deleting a user by ID (`DELETE /users/:id`)

#### Plan:
- **Enhancements to Consider:**
  - Implement error handling for database operations to provide more informative responses in case of failures.
  - Add input validation for user data in the `POST` and `PUT` routes to ensure data integrity.
  - Consider adding logging for requests and responses to monitor server activity.

#### Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `backend/server.js` will be the primary file to modify.

#### Follow-up Steps:
- After implementing the changes, test the server to ensure all routes function correctly and handle errors gracefully.
- Verify that input validation works as expected and that the server logs relevant information.
